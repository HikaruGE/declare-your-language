Files used to generate Digiteo Chair talk in Paris, June 3 2015.

The Omnigraffle files are in a somewhat random state, since different
(unpreserved) versions of the same file were sometimes used to generate
material for multiple slides.

WARNING: uses old version of Keynote (5.3) and Omnigraffle (5.4.4).
