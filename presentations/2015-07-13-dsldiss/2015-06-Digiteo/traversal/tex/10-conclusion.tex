\section{Conclusion}

We have presented a theory that combines extended scope graphs with type
constraints to support language-independent specification of the name binding
and typing concerns of programming languages. We have implemented a proof of
concept constraint generator and solver, and used it as analysis framework in
the Spoofax Language Workbench, applying it to LMR, a model language with
interesting interactions between name binding and typing.

Further research directions include proving completeness of the constraint
resolution algorithm; extending the theory with operators to express additional
requirements on solutions, such as uniqueness of declarations; applying the
approach with more advanced type-system features, such as parametric
polymorphism; and exploring the application of constraints for other language
processing operations such as constraint-based refactoring \cite{SteimannP12}.

% \TODO{but it would be a good place to put something about future work re ALGO

% record, etc.)}
