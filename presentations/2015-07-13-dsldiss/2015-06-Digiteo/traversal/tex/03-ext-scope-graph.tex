\section{Extended Scope Graphs}\sectionlabel{extscopegraph}

In this section we recall the formal theory of name resolution of Neron et al.
\cite{NeronTVW-ESOP-2015} consisting of a scope graph model and resolution
calculus, and extend the model with direct imports to model type-dependent name
resolution as introduced in the previous section. 
% For ease of reference, we have
% included the formal rules of the resolution calculus in \Appendix{rescalc}.

\subsection{Scope Graphs}

A \emph{scope graph} is a language-independent model for representing the name
binding structure of programs. A scope graph $\G$ is built around three basic
types of nodes derived from the program abstract syntax tree (AST),
\emph{declarations, references, and scopes}:
\begin{itemize}
 \item A \emph{declaration} is an occurrence of an identifier that introduces a
 name. $\di{x}{i}$ denotes the definition of name $x$ at position $i$ in the
 program. 
 We omit the position $i$ when this can be inferred from context.
 $\D{\G}$ denotes the set of references of $\G$.
 \item A \emph{reference} is an occurrence of an identifier referring to a
 declaration. We write $\ri{x}{i}$ for a reference with name $x$ at position
 $i$. 
 Again, the position $i$ may be omitted when it can be inferred from
 context. 
 $\R{\G}$ denotes the set of references of $\G$.
 \item A \emph{scope} is an abstraction over a set of nodes in the AST that
 behave uniformly with respect to name binding. $\S{\G}$ denotes the set of
 scopes of $\G$.
\end{itemize}
Given these sets, a scope graph is defined by the following functions:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Each declaration $d$ in $\DG$ is declared within a scope denoted
 $\scopeof(d)$.
 \item Each declaration $d$ has an optional \emph{associated scope},
 $\defscope(d)$ that is the scope corresponding to the body of the
 declaration. For example, the declarations in a module are elements of its
 associated scope.
 \item Each reference $r$ in $\RG$ is declared within a scope denoted
 $\scopeof(r)$.
 \item Each scope $S$ in $\SG$ has an optional \emph{parent scope} $\P{S}$ that 
 corresponds to its \emph{lexically enclosing scope}. The parent relation has
 to be well-founded, i.e. there is no infinite sequence $S_n$ such that 
 $S_{n+1} = \P{S_n}$.
 \item Each scope $S$ has an associated set of references $\I{S}$, that 
 represents the \emph{imports} in this scope
\end{itemize}
We define by comprehension the set of declarations enclosed in a scope
$S$, as $\D{S} = \{ d \mid \rscopeof{d}{S}\}$.

\subsection{Resolution Calculus}

Given this model, the \emph{resolution calculus} defines the \emph{resolution}
of a reference to a declaration in a scope graph \cite{NeronTVW-ESOP-2015} as
the minimal path from reference to declaration through parent and import edges.
A path $p$ is a list of steps representing the atomic scope transitions in the
graph. A step is either a parent step $\pstep$, an import step
$\istep{\r{y}}{\ds{y}{S}}$ where $\r{y}$ is the imports used and $\ds{y}{S}$ its
corresponding declaration or a declaration step $\dstep{\d{x}}$ leading to a
declaration $\d{x}$.
Given a seen import set $\seeni$, a path $p$ is a valid resolution in the graph
from reference $\ri{x}{i}$ to declaration $\di{x}{i}$ when the following
statement holds:\vspace*{-2mm}
$$\seeni \vdash p : \ri{x}{i} \resolve \di{x}{i}\vspace*{-2mm}$$ 
The calculus in
\Figure{rescalc} defines the resolution relation in terms of edges in the scope
graph, reachable declarations, and visible declarations.

The resolution calculus is parametrized by two predicates on paths, a
\emph{well-formedness predicate} $WF(p)$ and an \emph{ordering relation} $<$
that allows the formalization of different name-binding policies such as
transitive vs non-transitive imports. A typical definition of the
well-formedness predicate is \emph{no-parents-after-imports}, which entails that
a resolution can not proceed to a lexical parent after an import transition.
\Figure{order} presents the definition of paths ($p$) consisting of steps ($s$)
and an example of a path well-formedness predicate and path ordering relation.
This configuration supports arbitrary levels of lexical scope ($\pstep^*$),
transitive imports ($\sistep{\_}^*$), no-parents-after-imports (an $\sistep{\_}$
step cannot be followed by a $\pstep$), prefer local declarations over imported
declarations ($DI$), prefer local declarations over declarations in parents
($DP$), and prefer imported declarations over declarations in parents ($IP$).


\subsection{Direct Imports}

% The scope graph model and resolution calculus provide a large coverage of
% binding constructors in existing programming languages. However, it does not
% support the dependence of resolution of a reference on the \emph{type} of an
% expression. For example, in an object-oriented language, the name \cod{x} in
% \cod{e.x} has to be resolved to the declaration of the field \cod{x} that
% appears in some class definition \cod{A} that is the type of the
% receiver expression \cod{e}.

In order to model type-depdendent name resolution we extend the scope graph with
\emph{direct imports}. A direct import defines a direct link between two scopes
without the use of a reference. In addition to its set of associated imports
(references of the form $\r{x}$), a scope is extended with an associated set of
direct imports $\IS{S}$ consisting of other scopes in the graph. For these
imports we introduce the $(D)$ scope transition rule, which is similar to the
$(I)$ rule of the original calculus, except that this transition does not
require the intermediate resolution of a reference:
\smallskip

\infrule{D}{\si{S_2} \in \IS{S_1}}{\seeni \vdash \sistep{S_2} : S_1 \edge S_2}  

\smallskip\noindent
The complete resolution calculus with this new rule is presented in Figure \ref{fig:rescalc}.
