We describe a language-independent theory for name binding and resolution,
suitable for programming languages with complex scoping rules including both
lexical scoping and modules. We formulate name resolution as a two-stage
problem. First a language-independent scope graph is constructed using
language-specific rules from an abstract syntax tree. Then references in the
scope graph are resolved to corresponding declarations using a
language-independent resolution process. We introduce a resolution calculus as a
concise, declarative, and language-independent specification of name resolution.
We develop a resolution algorithm that is sound and complete with respect to the
calculus. Based on the resolution calculus we develop language-independent
definitions of $\alpha$-equivalence and rename refactoring. We illustrate the
approach using a small example language with modules. In addition, we show how
our approach provides a model for a range of name binding patterns in existing
languages.
