This is a book (in progress) about declarative language definition with the Spoofax Language
Workbench.
The aim of Spoofax is to separate the various concerns of language definition
and implementation and provide high-level declarative meta-languages for each
concern such that language designers are not distracted by language implementation
details.
These meta-languages are declarative in the sense that they abstract from the
_how_ of language implementation and focus on the _what_ of language
design.
For example, 'what is the syntax of my language?', instead of 'how do I
implement a parser for my language?'.

The book provides a tutorial introduction to the current state of Spoofax, and will be gradually extended, improved, and updated as Spoofax evolves. Your feedback will be in the form of emails, issues, or pull requests will be most encouraging to keep that up.
