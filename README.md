This is a book (in progress) about declarative language definition with the Spoofax Language
Workbench.
The aim of Spoofax is to separate the various concerns of language definition
and implementation and provide high-level declarative meta-languages for each
concern.
These meta-languages are declarative in the sense that they abstract from the
_how_ of language implementation and focus on the _what_ of language
design.
For example, 'what is the syntax of my language?', instead of 'how do I
implement a parser for my language?'.
Thus, a language designer should not be distracted by language implementation
details.
