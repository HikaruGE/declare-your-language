Testing is indispensible during language development to validate that your
language definition corresponds to your mental design of the language. Automatic
testing is also indispensible for maintenance of your language; does your
language extension still support all the original use cases?

In this chapter we discuss how to test a Spoofax language definition using the
SPT testing language \cite{KatsVV11a}. 

The example project 

\href{\LanguagesRepo/LanguageA}{LanguageA}

\section{Testing with SPT}

We start by adding a \texttt{test/} directory to our project.

defining tests 

start symbol



\begin{verbatim}
language LangA

start symbol Expr

setup [[
	
]]

test integer constant [[
  101
]] parse succeeds
 
test addition [[
  1 + 2
]] parse succeeds
 
test double plus [[
  1 ++ 2
]] parse fails
\end{verbatim}


\section{Examples}

SPT is great, but does not cover all usage scenarios

Also, debugging of various aspects 

Therefore, I always develop a collection of example programs in 
\texttt{examples/} directory of a language project. ()
