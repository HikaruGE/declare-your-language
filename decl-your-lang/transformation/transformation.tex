\chapter{Transformation with Stratego}
\chapterlabel{transformation}

The parsers generated from SDF3 syntax definitions produce abstract syntax
terms. Semantic manipulation of programs in Spoofax is done by manipulating
these terms. In this chapter we study the definition of transformations on
(abstract syntax) terms with the Stratego strategic rewriting language.

\section{Term Transformations}

A desugaring transformation simplifies the programs of a language to use only a
subset of the constructs of the language or only simplified applications of
constructs. 
For example, \Figure{desugaring-concrete} shows a program before and after
desugaring let bindings and sequential compositions. After desugaring, let
bindings contain only a single binding sequential composition `blocks' contain
at most two expresssions (and no `skips').
\Figure{desugaring-abstract} shows the abstract syntax term of the same
program before and after desugaring.

\Figure{Terms.sdf3} defines the syntax of the format of terms that we use here.
A term is a string literal, a number literal, a constructor application, or a
list of terms (between square brackets.)
The algebraic signature corresponding to a syntax definition describes the
subset of terms that are well-formed abstract syntax terms.

Thus, defining a transformation such as desugaring on programs, requires a
transformation on the underlying abstract syntax terms. 
The Stratego language supports the definition of such transformations by means
of term rewrite rules.

\section{Term Rewrite Rules}

A term rewrite rule is a schematic description of a transformation on terms.
For example, the rule

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Stratego]
desugar-let :
  Let([b1, b2 | bs], e) -> Let([b1], Let([b2 | bs], e))
\end{lstlisting}

transforms a \texttt{Let} term with a list containing at least two bindings
(\texttt{b1} and \texttt{b2}) and some other bindings (\texttt{bs}), into a
\texttt{Let} term with the first binding \texttt{b1} and a nested \texttt{Let}
with the other bindings.
In general, a term rewrite rule has the form

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Stratego]
l : lhs -> rhs
\end{lstlisting}

where \texttt{l} is the name of the rule, and \texttt{lhs} and \texttt{rhs} are
\emph{term patterns}.
A rewrite rule applies to a term if the left-hand side pattern \emph{matches}
the term, and results in the instantiation of the right-hand side pattern,
replacing the pattern variables with the terms bound to them by the match.

\Figure{desugar-rules.str} gives more examples of desugaring rules on
expressions.

\paragraph{Term Patterns and Pattern Matching}

A term \texttt{pattern} is a term extended with variables and list match
patterns as formalized by the syntax definition in \Figure{Patterns.sdf3}.
Roughly, a term matches a pattern if it has the same
shape as the pattern. That is, a term matches a pattern if its outermost constructor is the
same as the outermost constructor of the pattern, and the sub-terms match the
corresponding sub-patterns, or the pattern is a variable.
\Figure{pattern-matching} gives a precise definition of pattern matching.

\begin{boxedminipage}{\hsize}
A term matches a term pattern if one of the following cases aplies
\begin{itemize}
  \item The pattern is string literal and the term is the same string literal.
  \item The pattern is a number literal and the term is the same number literal.
  \item The pattern is a constructor application \oldtexttt{c(p$_1$,..,p$_n$)}, the
  term is a constructor application \oldtexttt{c(t$_1$,..,t$_n$)} of the same
  constructor \oldtexttt{c}, and the sub-patterns \oldtexttt{p$_1$,..,p$_n$} match the sub-terms
  \oldtexttt{t$_1$,..,t$_n$}.
  \item The pattern is a list pattern \oldtexttt{[p$_1$,..,p$_n$]}, the term is a list
  \oldtexttt{[t$_1$,..,t$_n$]}, and the patterns \oldtexttt{p$_1$,..,p$_n$} match the
  terms \oldtexttt{t$1$,..,t$_n$}.
  \item The pattern is a list pattern \oldtexttt{[p$_1$,..,p$_n$|p]}, the term is a list
  \oldtexttt{[t$_1$,..,t$_m$]}, $n \leq m$, the patterns \oldtexttt{p$_1$,..,p$_n$}
  match the terms \oldtexttt{t$_1$,..,t$_n$}, and the pattern \oldtexttt{p} matches
  \oldtexttt{[t$_{m+1}$,..,t$_m$]}.
  \item The pattern is a pattern variable, in which case the term is bound to
  the variable.
\end{itemize}

\section{Term Rewriting Strategies}

Term rewriting is the repeated application of rewrite rules to a term.
In 

In traditional term rewriting a term is normalized with respect to a set of term
rewrite rules. That is, 

Instead of providing a standard strategy 

the exhaustive application of a set of rules to a term

normalization
