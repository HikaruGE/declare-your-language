{"name":"Declare Your Language","tagline":"A book about declarative language definition with the Spoofax Language Workbench","body":"\r\nThis is a book (in progress) about declarative language definition with the Spoofax Language\r\nWorkbench.\r\nThe aim of Spoofax is to separate the various concerns of language definition\r\nand implementation and provide high-level declarative meta-languages for each\r\nconcern such that language designers are not distracted by language implementation\r\ndetails.\r\nThese meta-languages are declarative in the sense that they abstract from the\r\n_how_ of language implementation and focus on the _what_ of language\r\ndesign.\r\nFor example, 'what is the syntax of my language?', instead of 'how do I\r\nimplement a parser for my language?'.\r\n\r\nThe book provides a tutorial introduction to the current state of Spoofax, and will be gradually extended, improved, and updated as Spoofax evolves. Your feedback will be in the form of emails, issues, or pull requests will be most encouraging to keep that up.\r\n\r\nThe current version of the book: [PDF](https://github.com/MetaBorgCube/declare-your-language/raw/master/decl-your-lang/releases/declare-your-language.pdf)\r\n\r\nAuthor: @eelcovisser\r\n\r\n### Table of Contents\r\n\r\n* Chapter 1: Getting Spoofax\r\n* Chapter 2: Testing with SPT\r\n* Chapter 3: Syntax Definition with SDF3\r\n* Chapter 4: Transformation with Stratego\r\n\r\n### News\r\n\r\n* June 22, 2015: Version 0.4: Chapter on _Transformation with Stratego_.\r\n\r\n* June 17, 2015: Version 0.3: Chapters on _Testing with SPT_ and _Syntax Definition with SDF3_.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
