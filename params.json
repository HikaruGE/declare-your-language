{"name":"Declare Your Language","tagline":"A book about declarative language definition with the Spoofax Language Workbench","body":"\r\nThis is a book (in progress) about declarative language definition with the Spoofax Language\r\nWorkbench.\r\nThe aim of Spoofax is to separate the various concerns of language definition\r\nand implementation and provide high-level declarative meta-languages for each\r\nconcern.\r\nThese meta-languages are declarative in the sense that they abstract from the\r\n_how_ of language implementation and focus on the _what_ of language\r\ndesign.\r\nFor example, 'what is the syntax of my language?', instead of 'how do I\r\nimplement a parser for my language?'.\r\nThus, a language designer should not be distracted by language implementation\r\ndetails. \r\n\r\nThe current version of the book: [PDF](https://github.com/MetaBorgCube/declare-your-language/raw/master/decl-your-lang/releases/declare-your-language.pdf)\r\n\r\nAuthor: @eelcovisser\r\n\r\nContributions (pull requests) are welcome.\r\n\r\n### News\r\n\r\n* June 17, 2015: Release 3: Added chapters on _Testing with SPT_ and _Syntax Definition with SDF3_.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
